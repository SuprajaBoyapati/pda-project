I have Considered the json api from punk api V2 documentation it contains the beers related information like name of beer, ph, first brewed, etc.
The 'request' module allows you to send http requests using python and the http request returns a response with all the response data
and also checking and printing the content of the response and the response is 200 which means it is successfull
